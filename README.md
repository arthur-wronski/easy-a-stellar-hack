Kale: Web3 Sustainability Rewards Program

Kale is a blockchain-powered sustainability rewards platform that lets users earn XLM tokens through sustainable actions such as purchasing goods online from eco-friendly stores (e.g. Patagonia) or going to local stores. These tokens can be used to fund green projects like reforestation efforts. Using Stellar's fast, low-cost, and transparent blockchain, Kale ensures that every contribution goes directly toward supporting eco-friendly initiatives.

Features
Earn Rewards: Users earn XLM tokens when they shop at partner sustainability-focused businesses.
Support Green Projects: Fund reforestation, renewable energy, or other green projects by using the tokens you’ve earned.
Automated Smart Contracts: Green project funding is managed via Stellar Soroban smart contracts, ensuring transparency and trust.
Projects are initiated with a goal and recipient.
Tokens are automatically released to the recipient when the funding goal is met.
If the goal is not met, users are automatically refunded their contributions.
Transparency and Trust: Every transaction is recorded on the Stellar blockchain, ensuring full transparency and immutability.

Why Stellar Blockchain?
Kale leverages the Stellar blockchain for several key reasons:

Fast Transactions: Stellar provides near-instant settlement (3-5 seconds), ensuring rewards are distributed promptly, and green projects are funded efficiently.
Low Transaction Fees: Stellar’s minimal transaction costs allow microtransactions without eating into the rewards or project funding.
Soroban Smart Contracts: Smart contracts written in Rust allow automatic execution of project funding and refunds. This removes intermediaries and enhances trust between users and projects.
Global Accessibility: Stellar enables global payments and cross-border transactions, making it easy for people around the world to participate in sustainability efforts.
Decentralized Trust: With the Stellar network's built-in decentralization, no single entity controls the system, ensuring that all participants can rely on the transparent and fair management of funds.

How It Works
1. Shop and Earn
Users earn XLM tokens as rewards by shopping at our partner online stores that align with sustainability values (e.g., Patagonia).

3. Fund Green Projects
Green projects like reforestation or renewable energy initiatives are posted on the Kale platform.
Each project is initiated with a goal and a recipient. The funds are held in a Soroban smart contract.

4. Automatic Funding
Once the funding goal is reached, the smart contract automatically transfers the funds to the project.
If the goal isn’t reached within the specified timeframe, the smart contract triggers an automatic refund to all contributors.
5. Transparent Tracking
Users can track their contributions, funding progress, and project completion in real-time via the Stellar blockchain, ensuring full transparency and confidence.
Project Setup

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

Prerequisites
Node.js and npm for front-end interactions
Access to the Stellar Testnet for development
Installation
Clone the repository:

Install dependencies for the front-end:
npm install
npm run dev

To interact with the Soroban smart contracts, use the Stellar Soroban CLI and testnet for testing transactions and funding scenarios.

Why Blockchain?
Using the Stellar blockchain for Kale offers several advantages:

Decentralization: Blockchain ensures that no central entity controls the rewards system or project funding. This builds trust among users and guarantees fair management of funds.
Transparency: Every transaction, whether it's earning rewards or funding a green project, is recorded and verifiable on the Stellar blockchain. This transparency is essential for promoting accountability in sustainability efforts.
Smart Contract Automation: Soroban smart contracts remove the need for intermediaries and ensure that funds are only released when conditions (e.g., project goals) are met. This guarantees that contributions are used effectively.
Efficiency: Blockchain-based automation minimizes the administrative overhead, allowing more resources to go directly towards green projects instead of being spent on management and fees.
Global Reach: Blockchain allows Kale to operate across borders without the friction of traditional payment systems, making it accessible to a global audience.
